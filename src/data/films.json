It also responds well to over- and under-exposure, and can be rated from EI 100-1600 for acceptable results with adequate processing. The film is coated on an anti-curl 135 µm-thick acetate base and also incorporates an anti-halation layer, which clears during development, for improved overall sharpness and highlight clarity.",

It has a nominal sensitivity of ISO 400/27°, however can be under- or overexposed in order to adjust contrast as well as the balance of grain and sharpness. When rated at ISO 400, the most neutral balance between a fine grain structure and high sharpness will be afforded. Its wide exposure latitude can also be used to better control highlight and shadow values, as well as an expansive range of middle tones. Additionally, XP2 Super is designed for printing on traditional black and white papers, with Multigrade contrast filters, as well as on RA-4 color papers with maintained print color neutrality.",

Using a unique two-layer emulsion, this film is ideal for working in low-light situations and also retains a low grain profile that makes it especially well-suited to scanning. Also distinct, this film has spectral sensitivity to 750nm, which helps to cut through atmospheric haze and fog for greater clarity and contrast. This extended red sensitivity also benefits working in lower light conditions, such as during dawn and dusk, and its wide exposure latitude allows you to rate the film between EI 200-500 for acceptable results. It has low base fog levels when processed at high temperatures, making it suitable for high volume processing, and the emulsion is coated on a 100Âµm-thick transparent polyester base. Additionally, base substrate layers offer permanent anti-static qualities and a gelatin coating has also been applied to the back layer to resist scratching.",

It has extended sensitivity near the infrared range, up to 750nm, and well-controlled contrast in order to cut through haze, fog, and other atmospheric conditions. Its very fine grain structure also contributes to high overall sharpness and this film is particularly well-suited to technical, industrial, and aerial photography applications. Additionally, its wide exposure latitude enables rating the film at EI 125 with consistent results and controlled tonal values.",
